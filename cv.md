## About myself
I always wanted to be a teacher, but the Russian education system quickly brought me down from heaven to earth. So I decided to work with the passion of my childhood - computers

I've been working as a system administrator for seven years, fixing computer hardware and dealing with networks. But one day I had to develop a website. Without having any experience.

However, it was since then that I began to wonder how all this works outside of special services for creating websites. And here I am!

I also like computer games, volleyball and cycling. 
## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Basic)
- Git/GitHub

## Code example
```
function countPositivesSumNegatives(input) {
  
  if (input == null || input.length < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {

    let posAmount = 0;
    let negSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
     if (input[i] > 0) posAmount++;
     else if (input[i] < 0) negSum += input[i];
    }
  return [posAmount, negSum]
  }
}
```
## Experience
At the moment, there is no direct experience in programming - most of the time I worked with computer hardware and networks. Nevertheless, I studied independently with the help of materials from the Internet and free entry-level courses. I have experience in creating a multi-page website on WordPress.
