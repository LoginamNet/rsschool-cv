## About myself
I always wanted to be a teacher, but the Russian education system quickly brought me down from heaven to earth. So I decided to work with the passion of my childhood - computers

I've been working as a system administrator for seven years, fixing computer hardware and dealing with networks. But one day I had to develop a website. Without having any experience.

However, it was since then that I began to wonder how all this works outside of special services for creating websites. And here I am!

I also like computer games, volleyball and cycling.
